# WordPress Steem
Publish Your WordPress Posts on Steem Blockchain!

## Features
- Automatically converts your post content into Markdown format
- Automatically render WordPress shortcodes to Steem post (Assuming you are using the default WordPress editor NOT the Markdown editor)
- Publish your newly created WordPress post to the Steem blockchain
- Publish your old WordPress post to the Steem blockchain
- Update your published Steem post if you have used this plugin to publish that Steem post
- Set post reward options such as Power Up (100%), Default (50% / 50%), and Decline Payout
- Set custom post permalink for your Steem post
- Set post tags for your Steem post
- Easy to use User Interface

## Limitation
- No support yet for scheduled posts but it will be supported on upcoming releases.
- Conversion of post content to Markdown may be off sometimes.

## Note
You will require your Steem _PRIVATE POSTING KEY_ for this plugin to work. Your _PRIVATE POSTING KEY_ is <strong>NOT</strong> stored on our servers.

The plugin will automatically get a 15% curation reward from the Steem post created with this plugin for the use of development and maintenance cost with the beneficiary going to @steemful. (This is the brand I created for my projects related to Steem blockchain)
